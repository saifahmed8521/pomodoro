## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique follows these basic steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break (5 minutes).
5. After every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
